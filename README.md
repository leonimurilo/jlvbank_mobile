# JLV Bank
JLV Bank is a simple Android project that I've done in the fourth university period in order to introduce myself to the mobile world

The propose of the project was to create an App that comunicates with an webservice via REST API (HTTP) and allows the user (after a login) to see his/her invoices (that contains his purchases), credit cards and profile. The user can see the credit card details as well as the purchases details.

### The main things that I've learnt are:
* Basic concepts about REST API and HTTP Requests in an Application.
* Android basics including layouts, adapters, activities and fragment lifecicles and some important classes.
* Deeper experience with Java listeners and interfaces.
* RecyclerView including multiple custom ViewHolders.
* JSON handling using GSON


Due to the deadline I had:
* The strings.xml is not used.
* The data transfered trough the network is not encrypted

The webservice was created by my teammates and is available in the link bellow:
